# Fix Email Delivery Issue When Providers Change Booking Status

## Current Status: In Progress

### Problem Description
When providers change booking status (approved, scheduled, in_progress, completed, rejected), emails are not being delivered to users through the queue system.

### Root Cause Analysis Needed
- [ ] Check if Bull queue is processing email jobs
- [ ] Verify Redis connection or in-memory fallback
- [ ] Confirm email environment variables (MAIL_USER, MAIL_PASS)
- [ ] Test SMTP connection to Gmail
- [ ] Review error logs for failed email jobs
- [ ] Ensure queue workers are running in server.js

### Investigation Steps
- [ ] Examine server.js to confirm queue initialization
- [ ] Check queue.js for job processing logic
- [ ] Verify booking.js routes are calling addEmailJob correctly
- [ ] Test email functions in sendEmail.js manually
- [ ] Check for any unhandled errors in async operations

### Fixes to Implement
- [ ] Add more detailed logging to queue processing
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling in email jobs
- [ ] Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- [ ] Test email connection on server startup
- [ ] Add queue status monitoring endpoint

### Testing
- [ ] Test booking status change from provider dashboard
- [ ] Verify email jobs are added to queue
- [ ] Check if jobs are processed successfully
- [ ] Confirm emails are received by users
- [ ] Test all status change scenarios (approved, scheduled, in_progress, completed, rejected)

### Files to Check/Modify
- backend/server.js
- backend/src/utils/queue.js
- backend/src/utils/sendEmail.js
- backend/src/routes/booking.js
- Environment variables (.env file)

### Notes
- Queue system uses Bull with Redis fallback to in-memory
- All email functions have retry logic (3 attempts)
- SMTP uses Gmail with App Password authentication
- Need to ensure MAIL_USER and MAIL_PASS are set correctly
