# Booking Payment Flow Fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze current booking flow in BookingDashboard.jsx
- [x] Review backend booking API and payment verification
- [x] Add payment summary UI to BookingDashboard.jsx
- [x] Implement "Make Payment" button that triggers Razorpay checkout
- [x] Add "Back to Booking Form" button for navigation
- [x] Ensure booking is saved only after successful payment verification

## Summary of Changes
- Updated frontend/src/pages/BookingDashboard.jsx to show payment summary with:
  - Service details (name, provider, description)
  - Booking details (date, time, notes)
  - Price breakdown and total amount
  - "Make Payment" button that opens Razorpay checkout in test mode
  - "Back to Booking Form" button

- Backend code (backend/src/routes/booking.js) was already correct:
  - Creates Razorpay order when keys are configured
  - Sets booking status to 'payment_pending' until payment is verified
  - Verifies payment signature and updates booking to 'confirmed' only after successful payment

## Testing Required
- Test booking flow: Book Service → Payment Summary → Make Payment → Razorpay checkout → Payment success → Booking confirmed
- Ensure Razorpay opens in test mode
- Verify booking is not confirmed until payment is successful
- Test error handling for failed payments

## Notes
- Razorpay integration uses test mode with REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID environment variable
- Payment verification happens via POST /api/bookings/verify-payment endpoint
- Booking status remains 'payment_pending' until payment is verified
