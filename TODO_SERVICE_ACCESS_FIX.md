# TODO: Fix Service Page Access Without Login

## Issue
- Clicking "Explore Services" on homepage redirects to login page
- Clicking "Services" in navbar redirects to login page
- Services page should be accessible without authentication

## Root Cause
- In backend/server.js, the route order was incorrect
- `app.use('/api', protectedRoutes)` was registered before `app.use('/api/services', serviceRoutes)`
- This caused /api/services/public to require authentication

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Identify the issue in route registration order
- [x] Fix the route order in backend/server.js by moving serviceRoutes before protectedRoutes
- [ ] Restart the backend server to apply the route changes
- [ ] Test clicking "Explore Services" on homepage - should navigate to services page without login
- [ ] Test clicking "Services" in navbar - should navigate to services page without login
- [ ] Verify services are displayed on the page without authentication
- [ ] Confirm no redirect to login occurs when accessing services page

## Files Modified
- backend/server.js: Reordered route middleware registration

## Testing Status
- Code changes applied
- Requires user testing of the frontend flow
